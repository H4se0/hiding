As all who use Mac OS know finder doesn't really hide extensions with his option. This script does and it's fast. You need to install few dependencies then change username and directory where you want to store db file and log file, Script may be putted in cron. 
i've seen few other scripts which does the same, but they are slow and use too many resources. 

Dependencies: sqlite3, tqdm.
